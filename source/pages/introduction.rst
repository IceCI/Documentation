Concept
-------

IceCI is a continuous integration system designed for Kubernetes from the ground up. Running in the cluster, it operates on Kubernetes primitives while providing a layer of abstraction to make creating and maintaining pipelines more accessible. It also provides a web UI for visualization and easy monitoring of pipeline runs.
